# PageBreak

I created a blog based on [thinkspace](http://heiswayi.github.io/thinkspace/),
[a minimalist Jekyll theme](https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace) designed for
technical writing.

## Why do I start this blog?
My work heavily relies on writing. In the hope of getting my writing improved
and assuming that practice makes perfect, I started this blog. I also find that
trying to get ideas crossed forces me to reevaluate my ideas on a rational
ground and ignites new thoughts.

This blog is my investment in my mind.
