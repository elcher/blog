I created a blog based on [thinkspace](http://heiswayi.github.io/thinkspace/),
[a minimalist Jekyll theme](https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace) designed for
technical writing.

## Why do I start this blog?
My work heavily relies on writing. In the hope of getting my writing improved
and assuming that practice makes perfect, I started this blog.

Despite this aforementioned reason, I find that trying to get ideas crossed
forces me to reevaluate my ideas on a rational ground. This process not only
deepens my understanding but also inspires new thoughts. This blog is my
investment in my mind.
