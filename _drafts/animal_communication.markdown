#### Genetic Hypothesis ####

According to the genetic hypothesis, human language is a biological
endowment. This hypothesis predicts that species with this biological endowment
will all acquire language and species without this biological endowment will not
acquire language. How do find species with and without this biological endowment
to test this hypothesis? 

##### language acquisition is species uniform #####

##### language acquisition is species specific #####
