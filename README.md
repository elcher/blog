# ZBUniversity

I created a blog based
on [thinkspace](http://heiswayi.github.io/thinkspace/), [a minimalist Jekyll theme](https://github.com/heiswayi/thinkspace) designed for technical writing.

## What does ZB stand for?
If the abbreviation makes sense to you, it stands for what you think it stands for. If it does not make any sense to you, it does not stand for anything.

## Why do I start this blog?
I have recently realized that my writing is not as good as I think it is. It takes me a long time to finish writing an argument, which is frustrating because my work heavily relies on writing. In the hope of getting my writing improved and the assumption that practice makes perfect, I start this blog.

Despite this aforementioned reason, I find that trying to get ideas crossed forces me to evaluate my ideas on a rational ground and nevertheless inspires new thoughts. This blog is my investment in my mind.
